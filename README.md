AMANDA is short for Autonomous Meta-Data Analysis, Non-Sentient Directive-Based Aggregator. AMANDA is designed to aggregate large amounts of information 
much of which has already been subjected to a form of analysis and employ that data in the context of three primary types of social constraints.

1. Digital Constraints (created by machine hardware, circuitry firmware and software)
2. Physical Constraints (as created by physical structures which individuals and machines must move around or interact with).
3. Constitutional Constraints (which govern the conduct of individuals and the machines which they operate).

AMANDA can be used to analyze information and to answer questions about the data based on social contexts and societies structural constraints.

At its core AMANDA is designed to apply these three sets of constraints to any raw data set in order to derive meaningful information from the data. AMANDA is used to help turn raw data in to answers to social questions.

For example, imagine a touch screen device which contains only 10 buttons center aligned one stacked on top of the other with 100px of free space 
between each button. 

In this example the user is effectively presented with 10 options.

AMANDA is used to analyze the application source code and also to analyze the machine log data. AMANDA analyzes these to data sets through the application of the three types of constraints. 

The buttons in this example define a set of options or pathways while the free space, not containing any events, acts as a constraint holding the buttons in place and also guiding the user interaction to the buttons much in the same way that hallway walls guide a user to hallway doors. 

For example the AMANDA data engine can be used to analyze the source code and the log data and reduce it into the options and constraints described above. After contextualizing the information the context (option/constraint) can be applied to the datastream produced by the running application. AMANDA can then apply the context (option/constraint) to the datastream to create meaning from the raw data. Meaning in this example is defined by the AMANDA user in the form of questions they want answered by the data. For example: 

1. Was the button pressed at time X?
2. Did an event fire when the button was pressed at time X?
3. Did the event handler throw an exception when the button was pressed at time X?
4. If the user did not press a button at time X did the user press the space around the button at time X?
5. How did the application handle the touching of the space around the button at time X?

This information can be used in an aiOps pipeline to adjust the content or the application that is running on the device.

Another common form of digital constraint is network layer 3 routing and firewalling. AMANDA can be used to analyze the WAN or LAN routing and firewall rules defined by a network administrator and turn them into context meaningful in terms of agency or pathway and structure or constraint. 

AMANDA can initially be used to produce a list of paths a packet can take from Machine A to Machine B. This list of paths is understood by AMANDA to be the agency, options or will made available to a user. 

AMANDA can also be used to produce a list of networks or machines which will reject, return or deny packets moving from Machine A to Machine B. These pathways are understood by AMANDA to be constraints around which the user must work while sending a packet from Machine A to Machine B.

AMANDA can be used to generate aa complete picture of the entire "structure" represented by the networked system complete with options for moving a packet from Machine A to Machine B and also complete with a definition of blocked pathways representing the constraints embedded within the structure. 

AMANDA can be used to analyze software sources. Again the main function of AMANDA is, in this example, contextualizing the source code into socially meaningful information through the application of agency, structure and constraint. The contextualized information is then more efficiently analyzed by AMANDA in order to derive specific answers from the data. Some example questions which AMANDA can answer based on the contextualized information (source code) are: 

1. Does the app collect more information than is allowed by the constitution?
2. Does a network connected device transmit signals outside the FCC regulation governing devices?
3. Have these signals historically caused individuals to walk into walls?
4. Is it the device hardware, firmware or software which is breaking the constitutionally derived FCC regulations?
5. Does an application codebase try to transmit sensitive or compartmentalized information?
6. Does an application code base try to export encryption technology?

AMANDA can be used to analyze information about the physical environment through a similar breakdown of agency, structure and constraint. For example, the GPS data of an Apple Watch user combined with the blue prints of a house serve as the raw information in this example. AMANDA can be used to turn the blueprints into information meaningful to a blind person by analyzing the physical structures like walls, doors, fixtures and furnniture as objects that a person must walk around. The GPS data from the Apple Watch represents data about the individuals agency or will. IE: where do they choose to be at any given point in time. The walls and other physical structures, in reverse, represent the constraints of the system the person exists within. IE: where they cannot choose to be at any given point in time. After breaking down the GPS and blueprint data into these contexts it can be more easily analyzed by AMANDA to determine, for example to answer the following questions: 

1. Is the person moving?
2. Is the person moving towards a physical object?
3. Is the person moving towards a physical obect which can be interacted with?
4. Is the person approaching a wall?
5. Is the person approaching a door? 

AMANDA could send a signal to the Apple Watch user telling them to reach out and open the door. Similarly AMANDA could warn an individual if they were about to cross into another individual's property or over any given property line.

AMANDA can be used to break down raw data in terms of the agency afforded to individuals and organizations by the U.S. Constitution and also in terms of the structural constraints defined by the U.S. Constitution. 

For example, constituionally derived legislation prohibits driving an automobile past 20mph in a certain city. AMANDA can analyze information sourced from city planning documents along with information provided by a vehichle's odometer or city radar program to determine that an individual is about to break the speed limit in an area. AMANDA can be applied to then send a warning to the user telling them to slow down. 

A higher level example shows that AMANDA can be used as a natural language processor applied by legislators to pending legislation. The natural language application in this example reads the contents of the pending legislation and then applies the constitutional constraints to the document to determine if the legislation is constitutional or not. It could be used to analyze the different institutional perspectives about any given legislation to determine which institutional and individual rights are implicated by the legislation and finally if any given right is violated by it.

The primary benefit that AMANDA offers is the efficiency with which it can contextualize and process information in data analytics applications. The second main benefit that AMANDA offers is its ability to selectively consume and apply information governed by structural constraints and individual agency. 

The application of agency/constraint contexting to data limits the intrusive nature of data analytics and artificial intelligence. Other big data analyzers, having no fundamental structures governing their their functioning, currently tend to wildly over consume data while chewing up resources through uncontextualized "deep learning."

1 AMANDA is designed to consume information (purchase) from DMZ (https://github.com/atlas-opensource/atlas-dmz) compliant networks and systems. 
2. After AMANDA purchases information from the DMZ compliant network AMANDA asks human beings to help her code the information using Coding(d) (https://github.com/atlas-opensource/atlas-codingd)
3. AMANDA is then written such that the data produced by the Coding team is used to train her supervised machine learning structures to analyze 
large amounts of data in the way described above.
