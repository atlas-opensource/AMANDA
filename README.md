AMANDA is short for Autonomous Meta-Data Analysis, Non-Sentient Directive-Based Aggregator. AMANDA is designed to aggregate large amounts of information 
much of which has already been subjected to a form of analysis and employ that data in the context of three primary types of social constraints.

1. Digital Constraints (created by machine hardware circuitry and software)
2. Physical Constraints (as created by physical structures which individuals and machines must interact with).
3. Constitutional Constraints (which govern the conduct of individuals and the machines which they operate).

AMANDA therefore takes in large amounts of data and regresses it such that it is meaningful in these contexts. 

For example, imagine a touch screen device which contains only 10 buttons center aligned one stacked on top of the other with 100px of free space 
between each button. 

In this example the user is effectively presented with 10 options.

AMANDA can analyze the machine data and source codes to determine what the user can and cannot do on this particular screen. 

The buttons and the free space in this example effectively define a set of options and constraints that the user must work within.

AMANDA allows big data analysts and aiOps engineers to analyze information about the machine behavior and user behavior 
when a user is pressing or not pressing a button on a touch screen device. 

AMANDA can determine for example that the button was pressed but no event fired, or for example if the user pressed the touch screen 
outside of the button parameters. 

This information can be used in an aiOps pipeline to adjust the touch screen content or the application that is running on the touch screen device. 

AMANDA analyzes and then handles information about physical constraints in similar manner. For example, the biometric data of an Apple Watch user combined 
with the blue prints of a house and other raw information from big data pipelines (correlated to the power grid for example) can be used to determine
the position of the Apple Watch user within the property and then predict when the Apple Watch user is approaching a wall or door. AMANDA could send a 
signal to the Apple Watch user telling them to reach out and open the door. 

Finally AMANDA analyzes large amounts of data in the context of Constitutional constraints which are applied in a similar manner. For example, constituional
laws prohibit driving an automobile past 20mph in a certain city. AMANDA can analyze information derived from city planning, Google Cars, maps, and other
sources along with information provided by a vehichle's odometer or city radar program to determine that an individual is about to break the speed limit 
in an area. AMANDA can then send a warning to the user telling them to slow down.
