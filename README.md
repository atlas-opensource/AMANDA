AMANDA is short for Autonomous Meta-Data Analysis, Non-Sentient Directive-Based Aggregator. AMANDA is designed to aggregate large amounts of information 
much of which has already been subjected to a form of analysis and employ that data in the context of three primary types of social constraints.

1. Digital Constraints (created by machine hardware circuitry and software)
2. Physical Constraints (as created by physical structures which individuals and machines must interact with).
3. Constitutional Constraints (which govern the conduct of individuals and the machines which they operate).

AMANDA takes in large amounts of data and regresses it such that it is meaningful in these contexts. 

For example, imagine a touch screen device which contains only 10 buttons center aligned one stacked on top of the other with 100px of free space 
between each button. 

In this example the user is effectively presented with 10 options.

AMANDA can analyze the machine data and source codes to determine what the user can and cannot do on this particular screen. 

The buttons and the free space in this example effectively define a set of options and constraints that the user must work within.

AMANDA allows big data analysts and aiOps engineers to analyze information about the machine behavior and user behavior 
when a user is pressing or not pressing a button on a touch screen device. 

AMANDA can determine for example that the button was pressed but no event fired, or for example if the user pressed the touch screen 
outside of the button parameters. 

This information can be used in an aiOps pipeline to adjust the touch screen content or the application that is running on the touch screen device.

Another common form of digital constraint is network layer 3 routing and firewalling. AMANDA can be used to analyze the WAN or LAN routing and firewall rules defined by a network administrator and further the network traffic in real time in order to determine when an attack is occuring and further be used to predict when an attack is occuring.

AMANDA can analyze software itself against the constitutional constraints which govern the information environment in which it is to be deployed in order to determine if it affords an institution more access to information or information systems than they are allowed by law. AMANDA could further be implemented in software analysis to determine if the software, when deployed, would be in violation of the rights of an individual, group of individuals or a company. IE: does the software collect more information than is allowed by the constitution? Does a network connected device transmit signals outside the FCC regulation governing devices? Is it the device hardware, firmware or software which is breaking the constitutionally derived FCC regulations? Does an application codebase try to transmit sensitive or compartmentalized information? Does an application code base try to export encryption technology?

AMANDA analyzes and then handles information about physical constraints in similar manner. For example, the biometric data of an Apple Watch user combined 
with the blue prints of a house and other raw information from big data pipelines (correlated to the power grid for example) can be used to determine
the position of the Apple Watch user within a property and then predict when the Apple Watch user is approaching a wall or door. AMANDA could send a 
signal to the Apple Watch user telling them to reach out and open the door. Similarly AMANDA could warn an individual if they were about to cross into another individual's property or over any given property line.

Finally AMANDA analyzes large amounts of data in the context of Constitutional constraints which are applied in a similar manner. For example, constituional
laws prohibit driving an automobile past 20mph in a certain city. AMANDA can analyze information derived from city planning, Google Cars, maps, and other
sources along with information provided by a vehichle's odometer or city radar program to determine that an individual is about to break the speed limit 
in an area. AMANDA can then send a warning to the user telling them to slow down. 

A higher level example shows that AMANDA can be used as a natural language processor applied by legislators to pending legislation. The natural language application in this example reads the contents of the pending legislation and then applies the constitutional constraints to the document to determine if the legislation is constitutional or not. It could be used to analyze the different institutional perspectives about any given legislation to determine which institutional and individual rights are implicated by the legislation and finally if any given right is violated by it.

The primary benefit that AMANDA offers is the efficiency with which it can contextualize and process information in data analytics applications. The second main benefit that AMANDA offers is its ability to selectively consume and apply information such that the intrusive nature of data analytics and artificial intelligence is minimized through the application of social constraints as a common regression. Other big data analyzers, having no fundamental structures governing their their functioning currently tend to wildly over consume data, and chew up resources through uncontextualized "deep learning." 


Footnotes
--------
1 AMANDA is designed to consume information (purchase) from DMZ (https://github.com/atlas-opensource/atlas-dmz) compliant networks and systems. 
2. After AMANDA purchases information from the DMZ compliant network AMANDA asks human beings to help her code the information using Coding(d) (https://github.com/atlas-opensource/atlas-codingd)
3. AMANDA is then written such that the data produced by the Coding team is used to train her supervised machine learning structures to analyze 
large amounts of data in the way described above.
